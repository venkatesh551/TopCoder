PROBLEM STATEMENT
Elly recently learned that vowels (the letters 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' and 'y') are no longer cool on the internet. That's why now she wants to remove some of the vowels in the nickname she uses. Elly wants her new nickname to contain no consecutive vowels, but she still wants to keep as many characters as possible.
You are given the current nickname Elly uses in the String nickname. Return its new length after it gets shortened.
